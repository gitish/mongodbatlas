How to run the code 
## Run below Command
```
    go get
    go mod tidy
    go run . 
```
//to run individual file 
change the function name to main
go run filename For example: `go run test2.go`


## how to do a concurrent performance test 
To conduct a concurrent performance test for reading data from MongoDB Atlas using Go, you can utilize goroutines and the `testing` package's benchmarking capabilities. This will allow you to simulate concurrent requests and measure the performance of your code under load. Here's an example of how to create a concurrent performance test:

To run this concurrent performance test, save it in a file with a `_test.go` extension (e.g., `concurrent_performance_test.go`). Then, in your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the test file and run:

```go test -bench=.```

This command will execute the concurrent benchmark, and you'll see the results, including the number of iterations per second (ops) and the time taken per operation (ns/op). Adjust the number of concurrent goroutines (numGoroutines) and the benchmark configuration to suit your specific testing requirements.


## what is testing package benchmarking capabilities
The testing package in Go provides a built-in benchmarking framework that allows you to measure the performance of your code. Benchmarking in Go is commonly used to assess the execution time of functions, methods, or code snippets under different conditions and workloads. The testing package's benchmarking capabilities are essential for performance optimization and ensuring code efficiency.

Here are the key components and features of the testing package's benchmarking capabilities:

**Benchmark Functions**: Benchmarking in Go is achieved by defining benchmark functions. A benchmark function's name starts with `Benchmark` followed by a descriptive name. For example, `BenchmarkMyFunction`.

**Benchmarking Setup and Teardown**: You can use the `b *testing.B` parameter in a benchmark function to control the number of iterations and set up any necessary preconditions before benchmarking begins. The `b.N` field represents the number of iterations to run the benchmark.

**Execution Time Measurement**: The `b.StartTimer()` and `b.StopTimer()` functions allow you to start and stop the timer during the benchmark. This enables you to measure the execution time of the code between these calls.

**Parallel Benchmarking**: You can specify that a benchmark should be run in parallel by using the `b.RunParallel()` method. This is useful for testing the performance of concurrent code.

**Benchmark Reporting**: After running a benchmark, the `go test` command generates a report that includes the number of iterations per second (ops) and the time taken per operation (ns/op). This information helps you assess the performance of your code.

Here's an example of a simple benchmark function:
```
func BenchmarkMyFunction(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        // Code to be benchmarked
    }
}

```
To run benchmarks in your Go project, you can use the `go test` command with the `-bench flag`, followed by a regular expression pattern that matches the benchmark functions you want to run. For example:

```go test -bench=.```

This command will run all benchmark functions in the current package.

The `testing` package's benchmarking capabilities are valuable for ensuring that your code meets performance expectations and identifying performance bottlenecks. By benchmarking different aspects of your code, you can make informed decisions about optimizations and improvements.
