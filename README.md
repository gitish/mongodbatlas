## how to do a concurrent performance test 
To conduct a concurrent performance test for reading data from MongoDB Atlas using Go, you can utilize goroutines and the `testing` package's benchmarking capabilities. This will allow you to simulate concurrent requests and measure the performance of your code under load. Here's an example of how to create a concurrent performance test:

To run this concurrent performance test, save it in a file with a `_test.go` extension (e.g., `concurrent_performance_test.go`). Then, in your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the test file and run:

```go test -bench=.```

This command will execute the concurrent benchmark, and you'll see the results, including the number of iterations per second (ops) and the time taken per operation (ns/op). Adjust the number of concurrent goroutines (numGoroutines) and the benchmark configuration to suit your specific testing requirements.
